              Building websites from wireframes that I had received. Some of
              those questions were: <br />
              These types of questions led me to miss numerous deadlines, and I
              wasted time and energy in back-and-forth communication. Sadly,
              this situation could have been avoided if the wireframes had
              provided enough detail. <br />
              Now that I am a UX designer, I notice that some designers tend to
              forget that wireframes are equally creative and technical. We are
              responsible for designing great ideas, but we are also responsible
              for creating product specifications. I admit that there can be so
              many details to remember that itâ€™s easy to lose track. To save
              time and energy for myself, I gathered all of my years of
              wireframing knowledge into a single checklist that I refer to
              throughout the process. And now I am sharing this knowledge with
              you, so that you can get back to being creative.
